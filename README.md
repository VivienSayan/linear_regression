# linear_regression
A python program that computes the two parameters a and b of a linear function of type f(x)=ax+b using a gradient descent method

Call the function gradient_descent(alpha,eps,X,Y,a,b) where:

alpha : the learning rate

eps   : a threshold

X     : a vector that contains all of the x values

Y     : a vector that contains all of the y values

a     : the slope

b     : the y-intercept

The results are printed and compared with the results obtained from a least square method
