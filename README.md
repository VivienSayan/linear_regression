# linear_regression
A python program that computes the two parameters a and b of a linear function of type f(x)=ax+b using a gradient descent method

Call the function descente_gradient(alpha,eps,X,Y,a,b) where:
alpha : the learning rate
eps   : the stop criterion
X     : a vector that contains all of the x values
Y     : a vector that contains all of the f(x) values
a     : the slope
b     : the y-intercept

The results are printed and compared with the results obtained from a least square method
